      Paragraphs are blocks of textual content that segment out a larger piece
      of writing—stories, novels, articles, creative writing, or professional
      writing portions—making it less complicated to read and understand.
      Excellent paragraphs are an available writing skill for plenty of types of
      literature, and proper writers can substantially beautify the clarity of
      their news, essays, or fiction writing whilst constructing nicely.

  A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph. It should be carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to talk about. Words chosen for this should not be cluttered and ambiguous as readers will decide to read further based on this. It is not necessary to write the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph. It can be put anywhere, as long as it reflects the main topic. For instance, if you mention that you are going to talk about the advantages of using the hand sanitizer, then in supporting sentence you should only talk about advantages, not the features or anything else.
